**codestat** is a tool that can be used to generate statistics about your code
by analysing its source. It works by collecting a series of measurements which
are aggregated into statistics that can be used to gain insight about your
code. It can be extended to include support for different languages and to add
new measurements and aggregation functions, or statistics.
